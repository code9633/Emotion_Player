# Facial Emotion Recognition Music Recommendation System

## Overview

This repository houses a Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) Music Recommendation System that can identify facial expressions and recommend music based on the detected emotions. It has been trained on various facial emotion datasets, including FER 2013, CK+, KDEF, and FERG_DB_256, to create a robust emotion detection model.

## Features

- **Facial Emotion Recognition**: Utilizes deep learning techniques to recognize emotions from facial expressions.
- **Music Recommendation**: Provides music recommendations based on the user's current emotional state.
- **Preprocessed Datasets**: Includes preprocessed and annotated datasets (FER 2013, CK+, KDEF, FERG_DB_256) for training the emotion recognition model.
- **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Allows real-time emotion detection from a webcam feed or uploaded images.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries and packages (list them in a `requirements.txt` file)
- A webcam if you plan to use real-time emotion detection

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash

# Facial Emotion Recognition Music Recommendation System

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. Download and preprocess the datasets (FER 2013, CK+, KDEF, FERG_DB_256).
2. Organize the data in a structured format for model training.

### Training

1. Train the emotion recognition model using the prepared datasets.
2. Fine-tune the model as necessary.

### Real-time Emotion Detection

1. Execute the real-time emotion detection script to capture facial expressions from a webcam feed.

### Music Recommendation

1. Based on the detected emotions, provide music recommendations to the user.
2. Integrate with a music API or service to fetch and play music.

### Deployment (optional)

1. Deploy the system on a web server or cloud platform for online access.
